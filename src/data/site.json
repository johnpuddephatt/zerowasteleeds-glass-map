  "welcome_message": "Last year we recycled over XXXX tonnes of glass across our city – an increase of over XX% over the year before. That’s great because glass is one of the most important things we can recycle – not only does it reduce landfill it also achieves some big CO₂ and energy savings.\n\n Use the map to find your nearest location for glass recycling and discover how much was recycled there and how much energy it saved."
