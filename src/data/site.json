  "welcome_message": "Last year we recycled over 12,000 tonnes of glass across our city – 37% more than the year before. Nice one Leeds! \n\n <strong>Did you know that our bottles and jars get recycled here in Yorkshire?</strong> Most become new bottles and jars, reducing CO₂ emissions and saving energy too. \n\nFind your nearest glass bank on our map and see how much glass people near you recycled last year - and how much energy all that recycling saved."
